# sdx-collate

The SDX-collate service is responsible for processing and packaging all business survey comments that have been
extracted and stored by sdx-survey.

## Process

The collate microservice is triggered daily at 06:00 via kubernetes CronJob. Reading from Google Datastore, all comments 
stored **prior to the current date** will be decrypted, added to an in-memory Excel file (xml) and sent to sdx-deliver via
HTTP: `POST` request: `deliver/comments`
